CERTH and VRTogether joined the 2019 edition of IBC, the world’s most influential media, entertainment and technology show. 
In particular, the VRTogether was featured at the Future Zone, a specially curated area bringing together the very latest ideas, 
innovations and concept technologies from international industry and academia. More than 300 visitors were able to try out our latest social 
Virtual Reality experience while more than 6.000 visitors visit our booth. Specifically, visitors met us at stand 8.F10 where our groundbreaking cost-effective 
social Virtual Reality experiences were presented for users in remote domestic scenarios, based on photo-realistic immersive content. 
Visitors wearing VR headsets were body-captured, inserted and immersed together in a virtual environment, where they can interact with each other in real time.
IBC brought together over 55,000 professionals from over 150 countries spanning the creation, management and delivery of electronic media and entertainment.
