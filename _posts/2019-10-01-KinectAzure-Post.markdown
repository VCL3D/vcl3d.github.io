# New Release Information

![alt text](https://github.com/VCL3D/vcl3d.github.io/blob/master/img/azure_image.png?raw=true "Azure")

<div style = "text-align: justify;">
The pre-orders were made! 
The first steps for a multi-view capturing platform with different sensors are indeed a fact.
We are currently waiting for the delivery of the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Kinect">Kinect Azure</a> devices to start the integration!
As you know our current version of Volumetric Capture uses the <a href="https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d415/">IntelRealsense D415</a> RGBD sensors. We 
plan to extend the platform's utility to be compatible with different sensors. Stay tuned for our next
releases of Volumetric Capture.
