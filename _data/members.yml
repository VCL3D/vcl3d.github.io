  bio: I completed my studies at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Electrical and Computer Engineering with specialization in Computer Vision. I was co-founder of a video game development company, SDS Game Studios (SDS). In November of 2012, I joined the Information Technologies Institute (ITI) and, since then, I have been working as a Research Associate. Iâ€™m currently working on human motion capture methods and technologies using depth sensors, Wireless Inertial Measurement Units, RGB-cameras and more, while, I am studying for a PhD in Computer Science at NTUA, focused on novel methods of 3D motion capturing and evaluation.
